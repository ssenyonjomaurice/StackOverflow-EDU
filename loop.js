/**
 * Create a file named for-loop.js.  
   
  In that file define a variable named total and make it equal the number 0.  
   
  Define a second variable named limit and make it equal the number 10.  
   
  Create a for loop with a variable i starting at 0 and increasing by 1 each  
  time through the loop. The loop should run as long as i is less than  
  limit.  
   
  On each iteration of the loop, add the number i to the total variable. To  
  do this, you can use this statement:  
   
     total += i;  
   
  When this statement is used in a for loop, it can also be known as an  
  accumulator.  Think of it like a cash register's running total while each  
  item is scanned and added up.  For this challenge, you have 10 items and  
  they just happen to be increasing in price by 1 each item (with the first  
  item free!).  
   
  After the for loop, use console.log() to print the total variable to the  
  terminal.

 let total = 0;

 const limit = 10;
 
 
 for(let i=0; i<10; i++){
    total += i;  
 }


 console.log(total)
 //You know a for loop?
